## PSF data should be stored in ./data

1) Each PSF grid should be stored in a single .npz file.

2) A PSF grid is a 5D numpy array of shape:
	
		(grid_height, grid_width, kernel_height, kernel_width,channel count=3)

3) Thus, it contains grid_h x grid_w different kernels

4) These files can be generated using the functions provided in utils_psf.py


## Image data should be stored under folders in ./images

For Example, the pretrain script uses:

	imgs_H in: ./images/DIV2K_train/*.png
	imgs_L in: ./images/DIV2K_lr/*.png
